    <!-- 
     what if i want to the guess is nearer or farther??
     what can i do?

     My idea

     Keep the track of lastGuess and calculate the difference between previousGuess and randomnumber
     curDiff = (randnum-userguess), prevdiff = (rannum - prevgues)
     if current diff is < prevdidff -> you are closer
     else if currediff > prevDiff -> you are getting farther
     else it is same as before
     we should also update the previous guess = userGuess and increase the attempts
